Radiology Assistant

This project aims to use a convolutional neural network in order to help interpret chest X-rays. It will determine if the X-rays are normal or abnormal. The purpose being to assist radiologists in prioritizing higher urgent studies.

Currently, this project is just for educational purposes and should not be used as a replacement for radiologist interpretations.

I am utilizing the NIH Chest X-ray dataset for training the CPP model.
